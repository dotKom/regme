2. Install project dependencies ...\
  `npm install` or `make install` or `yarn`

3. Build the project and generate documentation ...\
  `npm run build` or `make`

4. Build the project and watch for changes, re-building on changes ...\
  `npm run watch` or `make watch`

5. For [hot module replacement](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack) run webpack dev server ...\
  `npm run dev` or `make dev`


## Project structure
All the projects source files are located in app/src which is organized in a few different folders. src/assets contains all non javascript files including images, icons and stylesheets; src/common contains the shared independent javascript files like `constants`, so they're available all over the project;
src/services contains the services and their respective class models, these services acts as interfaces between the frontend and backend API; and the last folder src/components contains all the project's react components. src/index.js defines the root component App and is only responsible for bootstraping the app.

## Documentation
Build the project once and the documentation should be genrated to ./docs

## Config
All configuration is done via environment variables, note that the `/` at the end of all url's is required since urls are not cleaned at this point in time.
